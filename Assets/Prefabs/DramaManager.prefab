      to have it in battle!
    previousQuestSuccesfulNoMiniBoss: One of the prisoners we captured after the battle
      of [pl] gave us the name of [mbn]. I think we should arm ourselves against him.
      We should arm ourselves with  [r] from [cl].
    previousQuestFailedNoMiniBoss: As we fled the battle of [pl] the enemies shouted
      the warcry of [mbn]. We should defenetly be more prepaired next time. I heard
      stories of a great weapon from [cl].
    previousQuestSuccesfulMiniBossKilled: 'After defeating the [pa] we found a note
      on one of them containing this message "[ebn] commands you to fetch the [r]
      from [cl]". I think that this is a great opportunity to be one step ahed of
      our enemies. '
    previousQuestFailedMiniBossKilled: After we fled from the fight at [cl] we saw
      in the distance some [a] walking towards the [cl]. We should see what they are
      up to.

    previousQuestBossSuccessful: After defeating [mbn] and seeing how powerful his

    previousQuestBossFailed: After the defeat in the previous fight against [mbn]
      we should get more prepaired. I know of this [r] located at the [cl]. There
      might be some [a] there, but it shouldn't be a problem.

    previousQuestSuccesfulNoMiniBoss: The grand archer of Hildebrandus Castle lost
      his [r] at [cl] while fighting against [mbn]. This bow would be a great contribution
      to our cause.
    previousQuestFailedNoMiniBoss: After last [pt]'s defeat I went to the Tavern where
      I met this traveler, named [ebn]. He was talking about a mysterious weapon located
      somewhere in the [cl]. We should give it a shot at finding it! Though, it might
      be guarded by some [a].
    previousQuestSuccesfulMiniBossKilled: The [pr] was a great addition to our cause,
      however evil forces are gathering at [ebl] and we should be even more prepaired.
      Have you heard the tales about the [r] guarded by [a]?
    previousQuestFailedMiniBossKilled: Unfortunately we couldn't get the [pr], but
      don't lose hope there are still ways of defeating [ebn]. For instance there
      is the [r] guarded by [a] in the [cl].

    previousQuestBossFailed: Oh no we lost the battle against [mbn]! In the heat of
      the battle I noticed that he sent his [a] with a [r] for safe keeping at the[cl].
      We should launch a surprise attack and get it for ourselves.

      am sure we wont face anymore defeats.
    previousQuestSuccesfulMiniBossKilled: I sense that evil powers are gathering at
      [ebl]. The only way to stop them is to get the [r] from the [a].
