    firstQuest: I have heard tales about a powerful [r] in the [cl]. I would be very
      pleased to have it in battle!
    previousQuestSuccesfulNoMiniBoss: One of the prisoners we captured after the battle
      of the [pl] told us about the [r] which is of great interrest to our enemy.
      I think we should arm ourselves against [mbn] and retrieve it from the [cl].
    previousQuestFailedNoMiniBoss: As we fled the battle of the [pl] the enemies shouted
      the warcry of [mbn]. We should definitely be more prepared next time. I heard
      stories of a great weapon from the [cl].
    previousQuestSuccesfulMiniBossKilled: 'After defeating the [pa] we found a note
      on one of them containing this message "[ebn] commands you to fetch the [r]
      from the [cl]". I think that this is a great opportunity to be one step ahead
      of our enemies. '
    previousQuestFailedMiniBossKilled: After we fled from the fight at the [cl] we
      saw in the distance some [a] walking towards the [cl]. We should see what they
      are up to.

    previousQuestBossFailed: After the defeat in the previous fight against [pbn]
      we should get more prepared. I know of this [r] located at the [cl]. There might
      be some [a] there, but it shouldn't be a problem.

    previousQuestSuccesfulNoMiniBoss: The grand archer of Ahor Castle lost his [r]
      at the [cl] while fighting against [mbn]. This bow would be a great contribution
      to our cause.
    previousQuestFailedNoMiniBoss: After last [pt]'s defeat I went to the tavern where
      I met this mysterious traveler. He was talking about a powerful weapon located
      somewhere in the [cl]. We should give it a shot at finding it! Though, it might
      be guarded by some [a].
    previousQuestSuccesfulMiniBossKilled: The [pr] was a great addition to our cause,
      however evil forces are gathering at the [ebl] and we should be even more prepared.
      Have you heard the tales about the [r] guarded by the [a]? We should try and
      get it!
    previousQuestFailedMiniBossKilled: Unfortunately we couldn't get the [pr], but
      don't lose hope there are still ways of defeating [ebn]. For instance there
      is the [r] guarded by [a] in the [cl].

    previousQuestBossFailed: Oh no we lost the battle against [pbn]! In the heat of
      the battle I noticed that he sent his [a] with a [r] for safe keeping at the
      [cl]. We should launch a surprise attack and get it for ourselves.

    previousQuestFailedNoMiniBoss: After returning from the lost battle of the [pl]
      I read through some old scrolls describing a [r] at the [cl]. With this weapon
      I am sure we wont face anymore defeats.
    previousQuestSuccesfulMiniBossKilled: I sense that evil powers are gathering at
      the [ebl]. The only way to stop them is to get the [r] from the [a].
    previousQuestFailedMiniBossKilled: Even though we didn't get the [pr] we shouldn't

      equipment as we have now. I am sure with the experience we have gotten since
      the last battle against [ebn] will we be able to defeat him this time.
    previousQuestBossSuccessful: With the help of our extravagant equipment we were
      able to defeat [mbn]. However [mbn] revealed that the evil behind all the attacks
      on the land is [ebn]! We found out that he is located at the [ebl] trying to
      destory all the shiny armor located there. We cannot let this happen, let's
      attack him!

    previousQuestSuccesfulMiniBossKilled: The last battle at the [pl] gave the team
      a confidence boost. I am still afraid of the battle against the [ebn] which
      is right ahead of us.
    previousQuestFailedMiniBossKilled: The [a] really made me afraid of [ebn]s army.
      The team however is confident that we stand a chance against him, and want to
      attack him at [ebl]. I'm not sure I got the courage to be in the frontline
    revangeQuestWithItem: 'I feel more secure with the [pr] retrieved from the [pl],
      it will surely be useful when fighting [ebn] again!

'
    revangeQuestWithoutItem: ' We have grown stronger since the last time we fought
      against [ebn], the battle at the [pl] really boosted my confidence and i am
      not as scared as I was when we fought [ebn] the first time. I say we fight him
      again!

'
    previousQuestBossSuccessful: We beat [mbn], but I was very scared during the process.
      To make it even worse, we learned that there is an even greater evil terrorising
      the land. His name is [ebn] and he is currently attacking the [ebl]! The rest
      of the team wants to attack him, but I'm too afriad. Can you please leave me
      on the sideline for this one.

    firstQuest: "Have you heard about [mbn]? It is said that he wants to [mba]. His
      evil minions have been seen in every little corner of our land, Ahor. We, your
      champions, are the only ones capable of stopping this great evil from spreading
      even more, but we need you to lead us. \nUntil recently there was no sign of
      enemy activity near our village, but last night I heard some noise in the forrest
      just next to the village. A band of [a] were carrying [mbn]'s [r] to what they
      think is a secure location. I say we intercept this transport at the [cl] and
      have the [r] for ourselves."
    previousQuestSuccesfulNoMiniBoss: What a victory that was! The [pr] gained from
      the battle of the [pl] will certainly help us a lot in our cause. During the
      battle I found a treasure map that points to a location in the [cl]. I heard
      a lot of stories about this hidden treasure, some say that it might be guarded
      by [a], others say that those are pure legends and there is nothing to be found.
      I think that we should go and search for ourselves.
    previousQuestFailedNoMiniBoss: Oh, no! We lost the battle of the [pl]! I am sure
      that this wouldn't have happened if we had enough gold to buy decent armor and
      swords. Luckly I have good news for you! I know of a treasure hidden somewhere
      around the [cl]. The treasure is guarded by [a], but I think we can defeat them.
    previousQuestSuccesfulMiniBossKilled: 'What a victory! The [pr] we got from the
      last battle will greatly help us in our future battles. I received intel from
      one of our captured enemies about our next target, [ebn], the head of all this
      evil. He has raised a large amount of gold in order to pay for his troops. This
      gold is now being transported towards Ahor Castle by some [a]. If we can manage
      to ambush them at the [cl] and steal the treasure from them we will greatly
      increase our chances of victory. [ebn] will have no money to pay his man and
      we will gain enough gold to buy new equipment. '
    previousQuestFailedMiniBossKilled: The [pa] hit us very hard at the battle of
      [pl]. We need to get some better equipment for our next fights if we want to
      be able to defeat [ebn]. Luckly I got into the posession of a very old treasure
      map. It points to the location of a big pile of gold next to the [cl]. Unfortunately
      the place is teeming with [a], but I think that we should take our chances at
      this.
    revangeQuestWithItem: 
    revangeQuestWithoutItem: 
    previousQuestBossSuccessful: Awesome [mbn] was killed in the last battle! Just
      before dying he sent some [a] with a huge amount of gold from his location towards
      [ebl] where an even stronger enemy is assembling his troops. I think that we
      should go after those [a] and get the treasure for ourselves.
    previousQuestBossFailed: 'Oh no! [pbn] was better than us! We barely managed to
      escape from this fight. I wonder how long will we be able to run away from death?
      I think we should look for some ways to increase our power. Luckly for us I
      know of the [r] of the [cl]. If we can manage to get our hands on it, we will
      be in a clear advantage over our foe. What do you say? '
